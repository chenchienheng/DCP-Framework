# Project Status

This repository documents a conceptual and interpretive framework referred to as the **DCP (Decision / Constraint / Condition Processing) model**, together with its layered extensions.

The materials collected here are intended to describe *structural principles, reasoning patterns, and interpretive frameworks*, rather than to provide a finished system, product, or implementation.

---

## Current Status

**Status:** Conceptually stable / exploratory  
**Development phase:** Structural definition & semantic stabilization  
**Implementation status:** Not implemented

The current content represents a *theoretical and structural formulation* of a decision–constraint framework.  
It is not an executable system, software product, service, or operational engine.

---

## Scope and Intent

This project aims to:

- Describe a **generalized judgment and constraint framework** that can be applied across domains.
- Provide a vocabulary and structure for expressing:
  - conditions  
  - constraints  
  - dependencies  
  - uncertainty  
  - interpretive boundaries  
- Support future exploration, discussion, or implementation by others.

It does **not** aim to:

- Provide production-ready software  
- Replace professional judgment or domain expertise  
- Offer legal, engineering, financial, or regulatory advice  
- Guarantee correctness, safety, or compliance  
- Function as an autonomous or decision-making system

## Layered Structure (Conceptual)

The repository is organized into conceptual layers:

### Layer 0 — Core Model (DCP)
Defines the abstract structure of judgment under constraints.  
This layer focuses on *relations*, *conditions*, and *stability*, not domain rules.

### Layer 1 — Interpretive / Operational Layer (Xuanling)
Provides structured ways to express how the core model may be interpreted or applied within domains.  
This layer introduces **prompt structures, reasoning templates, and interpretive patterns**, without binding to a specific implementation.

### Layer 2 — Projection / Example Layer
Contains illustrative examples, scenarios, or domain-specific projections that demonstrate how the framework *could* be used.
These examples are:
- non-normative  
- non-binding  
- incomplete by design  
- replaceable or extensible  

They exist to aid understanding, not to define correctness.

## Non-Commitment Notice

Nothing in this repository should be interpreted as:

- a specification,
- a standard,
- a guarantee of correctness,
- a promise of implementation,
- or a claim of functional capability.

Any resemblance to practical systems, tools, or workflows reflects *structural similarity*, not equivalence.

---

## On Interpretation and Use

Readers are encouraged to treat this material as:

- a conceptual reference,
- a design language,
- or a thinking aid.

Different readers may interpret or extend the framework differently.  
Such divergence is expected and compatible with the intent of the model.

---

## Authorship & Attribution

This repository records the author's conceptual formulation and organization of the framework.

Reuse, interpretation, or extension by others should acknowledge the original source where appropriate, while recognizing that implementations or derivatives may differ substantially.

---

## Future Direction

Future development, if any, may include:
- refinement of conceptual definitions,
- additional illustrative domains,
- clarification of terminology,
- or experimental implementations by third parties.

There is no commitment to timelines or deliverables.
