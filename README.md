Overview

The DCP Framework (Decision / Constraint / Condition-based Process) is a conceptual framework for reasoning and judgment under explicit constraints.

Rather than producing answers, predictions, or decisions, DCP provides a structured way to describe how judgments emerge from conditions, references, and uncertainty.

It is designed to make reasoning:
	•	traceable
	•	interpretable
	•	revisable
	•	and context-aware

This repository contains the conceptual materials, layered structures, and illustrative projections of the DCP Framework.

概述（中文）

DCP（判定約束框架）是一套用於「在條件限制下進行判定」的概念性方法論。

它不是用來給出結論，而是用來描述：
判定是如何在條件、參考、限制與不確定性之間生成的。

本專案提供一種可被拆解、檢視與重組的判定結構，使推理過程本身成為可理解、可比較、可修正的對象。

Core Idea

Judgment does not emerge from rules alone,
but from relationships among constraints.

判定不是由單一規則產生，而是由多個條件之間的關係所構成。

Core elements
	•	Constraint（條件）
Explicit assumptions, limits, or boundaries.
	•	Reference Set（參考集合）
Data, examples, standards, or prior cases used for comparison.
	•	Judgment Result（判定結果）
Expressed as:
	•	✅成立
	•	❌不成立
	•	⧖未定（條件不足或衝突）
	•	Uncertainty（不確定性）
Elements sensitive to missing data or assumption changes.
	•	Minimal Irreducible Conditions
The smallest set of conditions that determine the judgment outcome.

⸻

Layered Structure

The DCP Framework is organized into conceptual layers rather than fixed modules.

Layer 0 — DCP Core

Defines the abstract logic of judgment:
	•	conditions
	•	constraints
	•	references
	•	uncertainty
	•	decision states

This layer describes how reasoning itself is structured.

⸻

Layer 1 — Xuanling System (Interpretive Layer)

An interpretive layer that organizes DCP into reusable structures.

It introduces:
	•	structured prompt patterns
	•	judgment schemas
	•	reusable condition blocks
	•	interpretation flows

This layer translates abstract logic into operational forms.

⸻

Layer 2 — Application & Projection Layer

Domain-specific projections built on top of DCP.

These are examples, not fixed implementations.

Possible applications include:
	•	engineering estimation
	•	specification review
	•	compliance comparison
	•	cross-source consistency checking
	•	scenario evaluation
	•	documentation reasoning

Each application is a projection, not a constraint on future use.

How to Read This Repository
	•	Start with Part 0 / Core to understand the philosophical and logical foundation
	•	Continue with Layer 1 to see how interpretation structures are composed
	•	Explore Layer 2 for illustrative projections
	•	Treat each document as modular and composable
	•	No single document is required to be read linearly

⸻

Design Philosophy

English
	•	Open-ended rather than closed
	•	Constraint-driven rather than rule-driven
	•	Interpretable rather than opaque
	•	Modular rather than monolithic
	•	Evolvable rather than finalized

中文
	•	開放而非封閉
	•	以條件為中心，而非規則至上
	•	可解釋，而非黑盒
	•	模組化，而非單體
	•	可演化，而非定稿

⸻

Intended Use

This framework may be used as:
	•	a thinking scaffold
	•	a prompt-design reference
	•	a reasoning template
	•	a comparison structure
	•	a documentation logic
	•	a foundation for AI-assisted workflows

It does not prescribe decisions;
it structures how decisions are examined.

⸻

Status

This repository represents an evolving conceptual framework.

It is intentionally incomplete, open to reinterpretation, and designed to support multiple future instantiations.

Closing Note

DCP does not claim truth.

It offers a way to make conditions visible,
so that reasoning can be examined, compared, and re-composed.
